### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I have always been passionate about technology and ultimately decided to major in Computer Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SWIFT and JavaFX
- âš¡ Fun fact: because I'm Russian, during my school years, kids called me a Russian Hacker, so I decided to become a developer.
